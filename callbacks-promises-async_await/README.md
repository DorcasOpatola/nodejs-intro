<h3>JSON FILE</h3>
<b>.json file:</b> is a file that holds JSON objects. 
It can be an array of objects, it can be an object directly.
The core difference is that, the KEY is a "string".
The value can be of other data types e.g arrays, numbers, strings, etc.
It NEVER accepts a function.
The last property in the file cannot be a comma(,).
