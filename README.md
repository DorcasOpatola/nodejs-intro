> <b>Microservices architecture</b> also simply known as <i>microservices</i>, is a software development model that relies on a series of independently deployable services.

is more appealing and useful to me as a junior developer. This way, I have to fully understand the codes I write for it to function as intended. Also, debugging and testing is easy to carry out.
<p>While I totally understand the whole concept of microservices, it will be a total waste of resources for small scale applications.</p>
